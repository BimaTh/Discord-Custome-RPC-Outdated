to add your own Custome RPC:

- Start by installing the required packages, you can check package.json. Be carful some are dev dependecies 
-  make an application at the Discord Developer Portal
- Complete its Required Variables in The clientIds.json following the Template (The first Object)
- Creat your application file in static. Rember the extention to be js.
- You can use the Prefelable static template by copy pasting and changing the required stuff :
    -The rpc Inputs (10:20)
    -linking the application id (23:25)

After your project is set up, simply start your command prompt inside The folder and simply start the project with nodemon: "npm run dev"

Enjoy.
